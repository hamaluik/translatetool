### This is just a sample `.flt` file to demonstrate translation capabilities.

# Why not?
-brand-name = FireFox

# By commenting a message with `tt-lang-name`, the contents of the message will
# be replaced by the localized name of the language (English, Fran√ßais, etc)
# tt-lang-name
language-name = English

# A more-or-less regular message
hello-world = Hello, { $who }! Welcome to { -brand-name }!

# HTML is supported
html-test = I am <em>very</em> glad to see you!

## Note that more advanced placeables like switches cannot be translated yet.

# The $photo_count placeable won't be translated
shared-photos =
    { $user_name } { $photo_count ->
        [0] hasn't added any photos yet
        [one] added a new photo
       *[other] added { $photo_count } new photos
    }.

# nor will the $user_gender placeable
liked-comment =
    { $user_name } liked your comment on { $user_gender ->
        [male] his
        [female] her
       *[other] their
    } post.
